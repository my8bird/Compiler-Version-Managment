INSTALL
-------
sudo ./install.sh

This will find your current gcc and g++ locations and place scripts in there place that will determine which version to run.  In addition the directory /etc/gvm will be created with the configuration file in it.

Setting version to use
----------------------
There are two ways to set the version to use.  Set the current one for your shell or set the version to always use in a directory.  To set the version to use for your shell simply run:

`gvm gcc=44 g++=44`

To set the version to always use for a given directory run:

`gvm gcc=44 g++=44 .`

Where the last argument is the directory to place the setting on.
